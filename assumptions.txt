The tradeoff between objective-focus and well-generalized, will result in creation of assumptions one way or another.
As I develop this system, I will have to put in the assumptions the dashboard makes to cut code and save time.

Assumptions
1. Transactions are made on valid trading days
2. From (1), the most recent available data is used to calculate portfolio value
3. Only One dividend may be distributed on a pay date for each asset
4. Only the first stock's price time-series is used to calculate portfolio value, certain dates may be skipped out but currently, a liquid stock is being used (AAPL)
5. Base Portfolio Currency CAD
6. Only two benchmarks are used and need to be manually tweaked for additional benchmark mixing
7. Portfolio Statistics and information are all calculated using daily intervals
8. Return calculated on Current holdings is equal to Sum{Today's value} + Sum{Sell-off Value} / Sum{Total Cost} - 1.
9. (8) implies all stocks use to be held count as no return
10. Sparklines start at portfolio start date
